Life in the community revolved around the flour mill, where families gathered to process cassava and produce by-products like starch, beiju, and manioc flour. These activities not only sustained the community but also strengthened their social and cultural bonds.",

  "projectGoals": "The project aims to support society in the search for solutions that promote improvements for specific groups or the community at large. Specifically, this website was created to address the lack of visibility and recognition of the rich culture, history, and traditions of the quilombola community of Barrocas.",

  "projectAdvantages": "I think that quilombola communities often face marginalization, discrimination, and limited representation in the media and society at large. By offering content that values and preserves the cultural, historical, and traditional aspects of this community, this website contributes to strengthening the quilombola identity and promotes greater recognition and respect for this significant heritage.",
